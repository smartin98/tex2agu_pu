# tex2agu_pu
Simple python script to estimate the length of an article prepared using LaTeX in AGU publication units as defined [here](https://www.agu.org/publications/authors/journals/text-graphics-requirements). Use at your own risk :)
\
\
\
Example usage:
\
\
`python latex_to_agu_pu.py --tex_path <FILE_PATH>`
\
\
Or:
`python latex_to_agu_pu.py --tex_path <FILE_PATH> --verbose`
\
to optionally also print out the text extracted by the script for debugging.
